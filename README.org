* Clojure-Emacs
This repository contains all the third party code required to make Emacs an awesome clojure IDE. Namely, it contains the latest versions of clojure-compatible Slime, clojure-compatible swank-clojure and clojure-mode. I use this repository as a sub-module in my emacs configuration.

* INSTALL
** Get the submodule code:
   - git submodule init
   - git submodule update

* Caveats
** caveat emptor:
clojure-mode-config.el is additional configuration for my personal benefit. It might not work as-is for you.
